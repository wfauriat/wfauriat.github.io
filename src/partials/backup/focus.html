    <p class="card-text">
      A role where rigorous ML meets real-world engineering — building AI systems that are not just accurate, but trustworthy.
    </p>
    <ul class="card-text mt-3">
      <li>Ship end-to-end ML products, from messy data to production API</li>
      <li>Make models explain themselves — uncertainty quantification, calibration, interpretability</li>
      <li>Bring statistical rigor to high-stakes domains where "it usually works" isn't good enough</li>
    </ul>
