        A small desktop app made with Python and PyQt 5, as well as some
        homemade back-end code using GPy for statistical learning and prediction
    </h2>
    <p>The objectif of this small desktop app is to help learning statistical inference
        and modeling with Gaussian Processes (GP). Here the exemple case or toy case
        is ballistics, where the distance crossed by the projectile can be
        predicted through the resolution of a simple ODE (ordinary differential equation).
        The data generated through the construction of a small DoE (design of experiments)
        and using an ODE solver, is then exploited to train a GP model. The GP model is subsequently used
        for prediction and uncertainty quantification analysis (sensitivity, optimisation,
        risk analysis, etc.)
