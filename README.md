# SPprofile

Interactive, responsive single-page portfolio for an ML engineer.

The reader can switch between multiple views of the same resume content — a condensed synthesis, a full detailed version, a skills-focused layout, and a projects/achievements layout — and toggle between dark and light mode. Theme preference is detected from the browser and persisted across visits.

## Tech
- **Alpine.js** — reactive view switching and theme state
- **Tailwind CSS** — layout and spacing utilities
- **Custom CSS** — glassmorphism cards, transitions, full dark/light theming

## Deployment
Static site, no build step. Deploy directly on **GitHub Pages** by serving `index.html` from the repo root.
